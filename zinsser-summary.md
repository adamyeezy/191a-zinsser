# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Adam Yee

Zinsser writes about how people phrase sentences in a more complicated way, rather than simply. His main point in chapter two is to simplify writing structure. Thinking clearly is necessary for writing clearly, and it allows the writer to free themselves from clutter. In chapter three, he writes about “clutter”. A long word or phrase is not better than a short one. Complicated wording and passive writing causes confusion for the reader, and this may cause them to get lost in the reading. Zinsser emphasizes simplicity and to weed out clutter.
